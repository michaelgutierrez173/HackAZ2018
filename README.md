My project for HackAZ 2018 - Personality Trait Hiring

Personality Trait Hiring

This program takes personality trait data of existing employees of a company to find clusters of similar personalities. When new applicants apply, they can take the personality test and the machine learning algorithm will find if they fit into a cluster or if they are an anomaly. If they are an anomaly then that applicant would likely not fit in with the company culture.

The personality traits are on a scale of 0-9 and the score can be determined by any way the employer chooses.
